  description: This cursed contraption bugs me to no end, but it has saved my butt
    a few times when I've been drinking too much oil. Any time I'm running low on
    juice or I can pull into port this thing'll let you know. And don't forget, don't
    crash into any mountains.
  internalNotes: Near alarm console
