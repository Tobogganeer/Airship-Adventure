  title: What's the Point?
  description: Ah my Harpoons. Not every ship has got one of these. But damn does
    Cloudbreaker get some nice retrofits, anyways these little pokers got some juice
    to them. Just point it at one of them floating barrel things. Drag 'em on board.
    Not quite a weapon, but you got pirates or some Buzz, just fend em off.
