  description: "A safehaven ha, kinda funny that mosquitos are afraid of the damn
    docks. Cause it\u2019s funny. I hated those things for years till I learned that
    the Buzzers hate the size of em. Listen here, stay safe stay alive. I don\u2019t
    say this much but seriously, does it become empty on these skies of nowhere"
  internalNotes: On Dock
