  title: Boiling Point
  description: "HA Get the pun? Boiling point? It\u2019s funny. LAUGH! Anyways. You
    gotta find some fuel. Those barrels that float around, they got some stuff in
    em. You can\u2019t open 'em. Trust me I tried. But they sure do burn well. You
    can find em everywhere, just toss them here when it\u2019s done. The fire likes
    it. Makes a kinda WOOMPfTH noise if you listen closely."
  internalNotes: By boiler
