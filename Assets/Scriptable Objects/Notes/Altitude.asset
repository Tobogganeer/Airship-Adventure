  description: Ahhh now this thing, this is a smart invention of mine here, this
    beaut will let you sail higher than any other ship in the sky. I know I know
    it is a bit ugly, but it gets the job done alright. Now this ship can move pretty
    dang fast, but it still takes a second to catch up to the black line where you
    want to be. Treat 'er well.
  internalNotes: Near altimeter
