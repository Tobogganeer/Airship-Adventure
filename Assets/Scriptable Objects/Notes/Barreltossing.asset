  description: "I never did that when I was here. Kinda funny, losing fuel. But hey,
    you ever need to relax or something, ---toss one off in my name or something---.
    I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019ll see it wherever I end up. Maybe I wont. But
    don\u2019t let the Buzz get their grimy snouts on it"
  internalNotes: Found if barrels fall overboard
