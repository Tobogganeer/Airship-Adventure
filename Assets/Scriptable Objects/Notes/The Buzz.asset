  description: "God Damn Buzzers, for a deadman I usually am pretty chull, or I guess
    it\u2019s Chill I never know. But those bugs. They eat the fuel that is worked
    so hard for. Damnit, usually I just get mad and throw whatever I can over at
    them. You know I might not have a spear, but a desk to the face works just as
    well."
